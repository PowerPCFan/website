<h1>Adventures with my PowerBook G4</h1>

<hr>

<p>I've always wanted to take apart my PowerBook G4. The hard drive is slow and clicky, and the CPU overheats due to dried out thermal pads. Now seemed like a good time to take it apart and give it an upgrade.</p>

<hr>

<p>Using <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/PowerBook+G4+Aluminum+12-Inch+867+MHz+Hard+Drive+Replacement/208"> a guide from iFixIt</a>, I disassembled the PowerBook and to my surprise it wasn't that difficult. At least I thought so...</p>

<hr>

<p>After hundreds of screws, I finally got the hard drive out. Next step was the CPU. I took out the display cables, BT and WiFi cables, and modem. I got access to the heatsink. When I took off the heatsink, the screws that hold it in place snapped off the motherboard. The 20 year old glue wore off. So I had to buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/J-B-Weld-8265S-Cold-Weld-Reinforced/dp/B0006O1ICE/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?keywords=jb+weld+cold+weld+epoxy&qid=1674328730&sprefix=jb+weld+cold%2Caps%2C789&sr=8-3">JB Weld Cold Weld Steel Reinforced 2-part Epoxy from Amazon.</a></p>

<p>That worked pretty well to reattach the screw. I was still waiting for my new hard drive to arrive though. When the Package arrived, it was empty!! Someone opened it, stole the contents, and resealed it. I was MAD! Thankfully I got a refund. I re-ordered it. Thankfully, it came.</p>

<hr>

<p>I put it back together and it worked smoothly. That is, until I turned it on one day and it shut off randomly. I'm pretty sure a part on the mainboard got shorted out (I hear a screw inside of the Mac) and the Mac just shut off. When I tried to reboot it, it SCREAMED. It just screamed and screamed until I removed the battery. It was a strange sound, almost like a cross between a car engine, a blender, and a baby crying. I gave it a week to rest, I shook it around, and tried to turn it on. It worked. I'll never know what happened that day. My "theory" is that there is a screw inside of it (I heard rattling noises) that: 1. Shorted out the motherboard or 2. Got stuck in the main CPU fan. I'm not sure but my guess is CPU fan because the strange sound starts whenever the fan turns on, but that wouldn't explain how it randomly shut off. It could have shut off due to overheating, though... I'll never know what caused this problem, and hopefully I can fix it soon. The End (To Be Continued...)</p>
