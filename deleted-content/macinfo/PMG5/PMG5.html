    <hr>
    <div style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; color: #ffffff">The Power Mac G5 was a series of personal computers
        designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 2003 to 2006. It was the most powerful computer in
        Apple's Macintosh lineup at the time, and was marketed as the world's first 64-bit desktop computer. It was also
        the first desktop computer from Apple to use an anodized aluminum alloy enclosure. <br><br> Three generations of
        the Power Mac G5 were released before it was discontinued as part of the Mac transition to Intel processors. The
        Mac Pro, which replaced the Power Mac G5, retained a variation of the G5's enclosure design for seven more
        years.<br><br><br><br><b><u> Thanks for reading about the Power Mac G5! <br> Fun Fact: I wrote this code on a
