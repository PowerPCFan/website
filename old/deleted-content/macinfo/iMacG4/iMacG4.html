</div>
<hr>
<div style="text-align:center; font-size:20px; color: #ffffff">The iMac G4 was an all-in-one desktop computer released by Apple in January 2002. It was designed to replace the iMac G3, and was succeeded by the iMac G5 in August 2004. <br><br> The iMac G4 featured a unique design with a flat-screen LCD display mounted on an adjustable arm above a hemisphere-shaped base. The base contained the computer's internal components, including a PowerPC G4 processor, hard drive, and memory. The arm allowed the display to be rotated and tilted, making it easy to adjust the viewing angle. <br><br> The iMac G4 was available in three screen sizes: 15 inches, 17 inches, and 20 inches. All models were available in white, and all models came with the Apple Pro Keyboard and Apple Pro Mouse. Optional Apple Pro Speakers were also available. <br><br> The iMac G4 was originally released with both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. However, when running newer versions of Mac OS X (Tiger and Leopard), the iMac G4's GeForce4 MX GPU was not capable of Core Image rendering, which caused some minor graphical issues. <br><br> The iMac G4 was a popular computer, and it helped to popularize flat-screen LCD displays. It was also praised for its unique design and its performance. However, the iMac G4 was also criticized for its high price, which was largely due to the high cost of LCD technology at the time.
