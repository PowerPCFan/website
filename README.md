# website
My personal website. For now, it's hosted at https://home.macintosh.garden/~powerpcfan, but I might move it to GitHub Pages at some point.  
The language says 100% HTML but there is CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, it just doesn't show because it's all in `<style>` or `<script>` tags in the HTML files  

Edit: currently migrating to GitHub Pages. New GitHub Pages site and old site linked above may be down at times.
