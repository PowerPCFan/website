<h2 style="text-align: center; color: white; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 30px">A Flash, A Zap, and A Line</h2>


<p style="color: white; text-align: left; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 20px">Sometimes, you can have problems with a CRT where you see a flash, a line on a screen, and hear a zap. It's scary! <br><br> Usually replacing the flyback transformer, putting grease on the anode cap suction cup, replacing capacitors, or re-flowing solder can fix the issue. Sometimes, it's a faulty tube and you need to replace the whole thing, but thet's extremely rare to have zaps and flashes as symptoms of a faulty tube.

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: white; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 30px">A Dim Picture</h2>


<p style="color: white; text-align: left; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 20px">First, make sure the brightness isn't turned down (in software or with brightness knobs.) You'd be surprised how many people think they have a faulty tube and it ends up just being a brightness control issue.<br><br> Another common cause is bad capacitors. Over time, capacitors explode or leak from use, wear, and tear, and sometimes they get too old and leaky to hold a charge and produce a picture. Check for leaky caps on your analog board. <br><br> Usually, the most common issue is just an old worn-out tube. Just like humans when they run, CRTs eventualy get tired and weak and don't produce as bright and crisp of a picture as they used to. <br><br> You can try and fix a worn-out tube, but usually it's not worth it as you will usually break it even more.
